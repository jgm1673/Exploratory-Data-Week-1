# Exploratory-Data-Week-1
Sample plots for the Exploratory data analysis week 1

The assignment involved plotting data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

Individual household electric power consumption Data Set 

Georges HÃ©brail (georges.hebrail '@' edf.fr), Senior Researcher, EDF R&D, Clamart, France 
Alice BÃ©rard, TELECOM ParisTech Master of Engineering Internship at EDF R&D, Clamart, France

there are four plots using the following variables:
1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss 

3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 

4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 

7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 

8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 

9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
